      <h2>About This App</h2>
      <p>
        This Book Management App was created as a part of my learning journey
        with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. I
        developed this application to enhance my skills in full-stack web
        development.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>In the future, I am planning to implement the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Login Functionality:</strong> To provide a personalized
          experience and secure access to your book collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> To ensure the app works seamlessly
          across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
